This code was developed to model a manufacturing process where a needle inserting a
chemical into a petri dish moved randonmly over a known distribution. 
The process was modelled and it's relationship to the profit function was found.
Monte Carlo Simulation was used to find the usage to provide maximum profit.
The results are explained in detail in the report.
